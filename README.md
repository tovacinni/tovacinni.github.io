# research-website-template

This is a template for a personal website meant for researchers.

In practice it could probably be used by anyone.

It is meant to be customizeable, all through modifying the `src/data` - which have arrays of objects that are used to generate the website.

For example, `src/data/publication.ts` contains an array like:

```
export const publicationData: Publication[] = [
  {
    year: "2023",
    conference: "International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)",
    title: "Robust Causal Discovery Under Distribution Shift",
    authors: "Jane Smith, Xue Chen, Sarah Johnson",
    paperUrl: "https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13095",
    codeUrl: "https://github.com/jsmith/robust-causal-discovery"
  }
];
```

And to update your website, you can simply add objects to the array.

You can also change the order of the sections in `src/data/section-order.ts`, and if you want full customization you can just edit the React components in `src/components`.

## Prerequisites

First, install Node.js and npm through the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

Verify installation by running:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Installation

1. Fork the repository

2. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd [repository-name]
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   Inside the repository, run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Application

1. To start the development server, run (in the repository directory):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/) from the creators of Next.js.

1. Create a [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/signup) if you haven't already
2. Push your code to a Git repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket)
3. Import your repository on Vercel
4. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and configure the build settings
5. Click "Deploy"

## Deploying onto GitHub Pages

1. In your repository settings, ensure the repository name matches `[your-github-username].github.io` if you want it to be your main GitHub Pages site.

????

2. Push your changes to the main branch. The GitHub Action will automatically build and deploy your site to the `gh-pages` branch.

3. In your repository settings, under "Pages", select the `gh-pages` branch as the source and save.

Your site should now be live at `https://[your-github-username].github.io/`.
